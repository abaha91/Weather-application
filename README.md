# Weather App

For starting with this project you need to install some application to your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

After this you need to open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory and run this command:

`npx create-react-app my-app`

This command will create a new React application in the `my-app` directory.
It will be just base application and you could customize it.

This application is created to demonstrate the basic capabilities of React using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Preparation for Launch

1. Register on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get a free API key
2. Open the file `src/services/weatherService.js` and replace the string `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your API key
3. Install dependencies using the command `npm install`

## Running the Application

Execute the command:

`npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
